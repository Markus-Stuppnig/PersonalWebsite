		<h2>Exchange Semester 2023 USA</h2>

		<h3>Decision</h3>
		<p>
			When I was about 13 years old, youtube recommended me a video of a girl, talking about her exchange semester. Unfortunately I couldn&apos;t find her again. She seemed incredible happy for experiencing such a cool time and kind of made me crave that too. Within the next few weeks I&apos;ve seen more and more videos of teens sharing their memories - mostly positive.
			Surprisingly on one day, my math teacher in lower secondary was talking about a carrier event that would take place in our school the very next weekend. My dad and I went there and soon found out about Education First (short EF), an organization that specializes in exchange years and language trips.
			We gave them our contact details, and almost forgot about it. But then, 2 years later they CALLED us - &quot;Is Markus still interested in an exchange semester?&quot; - Absolutely!

		<h3>Preperations</h3>
		<p>
			Around one year before my planned trip, the preperations started. There was in infinite amount of documents that had to be filled out, vaccines I had to get and health test I had to do. After these exhausting 12 months I was sitting at home, my luggage already packed up, going to sleep to be ready for my big day. The day I&apos;d cross the ocean and explore a new continent - at least that&apos;s what it felt like.
			After _Waking Up_ I saw the text from my hostdad Ben &apos;Hope you got some sleep&apos; - not at all - no sleep for me on the recipe.

				<h4 className="text-2xl tracking-wider leading-9">Since my early childhood, I have been immersed in coding. Solving complex problems and appreciating the simplicity of the solutions was truly fascinating for me. I was always good in math and decided to pursue my hobby in a technical college, an ISCED 5 school, this may have been the best decision I ever made. Having returned from my exchange semester in the United States, I will continue my education and simultaneously gain work experience. The technical topics I am most passionate about are cloud computing, cybersecurity, and data science.</h4>
